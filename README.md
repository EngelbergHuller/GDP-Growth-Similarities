# GDP-Growth-Similarities.
Data and R code assessing similarity of GDP growth trajectories for 90 countries over a 60 year period.
My first project in R, the code is heavily annotated for my own benefit.
I use data from the World Bank, World Development Indicators, and an R package called "Similarity Measures."
From this package, I used a function called Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS).
A blog post titled "Similarities in GDP Per Capita Trajectories" on the result of this project can be
found on the Engelberg Huller tab of my personal learning and knowledge management site Joeira.com
