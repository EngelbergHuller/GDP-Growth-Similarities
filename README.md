# GDP-Growth-Similarities.
Data and R code assessing similarity of GDP growth trajectories for 90 countries over a 60 year period.
My first venture in R, the code is heavily annotated for my own benefit.
I use data from the World Bank, World Development Indicators, and an R package called "Similarity Measures."
From this package, I used a function called Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS).
A blog post titled "Similarities in GDP Per Capita Trajectories" on the result of this exercise can be
found on the Engelberg Huller tab of my personal learning and knowledge management site Joeira.com

Warning: if you decide to run this code, the LCSS function took me about 11 hs to run each time so
you might want to plan accordingly.
